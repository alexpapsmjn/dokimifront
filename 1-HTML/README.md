# Exercise 1: HTML & CSS

## Recreate MJN's logo using only HTML & CSS

We have provided you with our logo (mjn-logo.png).  We want you to recreate this logo using HTML and CSS only.  **Do not recreate it using an SVG or Canvas**

![logo](mjn-logo.png)

## Deliverables & Tips

- We are expecting an HTML and a CSS file in this folder.
- Use **Ubuntu Condensed** as the text font (it's ok that it's not the same)
- The logo should have a max-width of 800px and be aligned in the middle of the page
- Bonus points if you can make it responsive
