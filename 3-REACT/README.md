# Reactive Form

## Intro

The final exercise is to create a responsive form that is reactive.  The end result is to recreate the form shown in the image *form.png*.  In this form, the user is able to select the days and times that they want to work, and to save their preferences.

You are free to design the data structure as you wish.  The only thing we care about is that the data you send allows us to differentiate the day and the time for each shift.  It would be great if you can do this in React using the [boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate), but we're ok if you do it in plain Javascript.



## Deliverables & Tips

- The form should be responsive
- The form should make an HTTP request with the selected data
- Use the following font icons for the [sun](https://fontawesome.com/icons/sun?style=solid) and [moon](https://fontawesome.com/icons/moon?style=solid)
- Create a [PostBin](https://postb.in/) and send your requests there when the user submits the form

- You may use a React boilerplate
- You may use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap or Material
